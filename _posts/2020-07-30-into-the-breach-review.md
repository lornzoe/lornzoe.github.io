Into the Breach is a simple, small tactics game that has an impressive complexity in its blood. The core mechanics are simple, but the real meat and bones is in how replayable the game can be.<!--more-->

The core goal of the game is to **survive**, not to kill enemies. You're not playing offensively, you're playing **defensively**. You simply need to survive for a number of turns and stop enemies from depleting your Grid before you win. Bonus objectives are bonuses; they can come after.

The most unique aspect of this game are the telegraphed attack system and the attack order system. Such focused, intent actions gives lots of clear information to the player on what to do. There's no mights and maybes to attacks, but definitives. 

The types of interactions this game can do is another strong point of this game. Killing enemies seems like a necessity, but the game allows the player to *manipulate* enemies to their bidding. You can kill an enemy to stop it from attacking a building, but you can also make an enemy shoot another enemy before the latter attacks the structure. 

With limited attacks and units, the dynamic shifts to a puzzle game; with lots of reliable information, you're now trying to mitigate as much damage as you can with the limited options you have.

The game also does a couple of things to limit how bad things can snowball. There's choice in the island map so that you can choose what you're going for in terms of bonus objectives. Even when you lose, you can send one of your characters to start a new run with. If you can't stop an attack, there's still a chance (albeit small) that it gets negated -- though that's more of a last resort. 

This game's amazing and I love it. I'm almost 20 hours in, and I've probably only done all the achievements for the Rift Walkers.

five outta five.
