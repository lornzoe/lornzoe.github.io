(obligatory: spoilers ahead)

Yesterday, I slaved myself from morning until night to finish up loose ends and obtain one of the most painstaking achievements known to degenerates like me.<!--more-->

The 'Don't Cheat, Daddy' achievement requires players to raise the affinity of all the heroines in the game to level 5 (the max level).

In order to get a heroine's affinity to level 5, you need to engage in what feels like a memory puzzle of a dating simulator. The picture above doesn't pull the whole picture. You're responding to individual prompts with the right responses, repeating until you get a full bar of happiness.

The problem is that everything is so broken in pieces that it's almost as if it's brain dead. You end up making up fantasies with the storyline of a third-rate fanfiction just to fill in the endless amount of gaps in the dating simulator. 

The only thing that keeps you from floating away is the ocassional vocal responses from the heroines. Suddenly, the only bit of character you're drip-fed (apart from the bed interaction scenes) are those little vocal responses that come after you answer every prompt.

You learn that Asuna is still as shallow as ever in character. Silica is nervous and insecure when talking to Kirito, like a teenager with no experience on puberty. Lizbeth is a strong woman, yet she easily shows hints of terror because of her dilemma between her desire to be selfish and wanting to keep her friendships together. 

Leafa is in a mix of worry and (some) relief towards her brother, from having the inability to do anything to help until she did. Philia is still shaken from the Hollow Area's events and seeks comfort from her nightmares. Sinon is always questioning whether she's getting stronger, both in SAO and mentally. Strea is more playful and attention-seeking than she was already percieved to be.

Even the side characters has gold, the fuck? Argo looks like she had a lot released when she's appreciated by Kirito. Hollow Sachi feels overburdened and overprotected by the person who had to witness her death, and comes to terms to it.

By all means, SAO is a terribly written series (at least, the first season was). I guess it's so bad that it's so easy to imagine and release/find a parody that fixes the disappointing aspects of the series. The actual scenes in SAO Re:HF fall under the following: mediocre, fanservice, cliche comedic cringe. The worst part is that I just can't stop watching them; I NEED TO WATCH THEM ALL.

I am currently watching a scene where the whole cast is role-playing to be Kirito's little sisters. Fuck this, fuck my life. This appeals to the male fantasy, and I shamelessly fucking love it.

I'll be writing 20 fanfictions over the events of this game. Fuck me, fuck yeah.
