Muse Dash is a simple 2-3 button rhythm game. The closest thing you can compare this to is taiko, but just really, really cute. 

There's something about Muse Dash that just keeps making me come back every month thanks to their monthly updates.

The absurd volume of pinks and purples that are injected into the game. The cute art style in their visuals.The music -- *oh my god, the music.* Every month they release a pack (usually 6) of curated songs; those tracks and charts are why I just keep coming back. The music is always from JP/KR/CN artists, and it's always the energetic ones. Any song you play will radiate its own energy and you're bound to have at least a favorite or two in every pack.

NOMA's Brain Power is in here; xi's Freedom Dive is in here; and there's many songs of this quality that I'm only getting to discover now; and there's still more coming in!

Muse Dash has solid foundation with absolutely adorable visuals and gameplay -- and then builds on it with consistent releases of great tracks and charts. It's weird -- it feels so simple, and in paper it seems like a great direction to update your game, yet the Steam storefront isn't flooded with games like this.

The update train doesn't look to be stopping any time soon. I love this game, and I'm looking forward to what we'll be getting next with high expectations.
